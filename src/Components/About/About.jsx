                        So how did the classical Latin become so incoherent? According to McClintock,
                        a 15th century typesetter likely scrambled part of Cicero's De Finibus in order
                        to provide placeholder text to mockup various fonts for a type specimen book.

                        <p className="about__wrapper-text">It's difficult to find examples of lorem ipsum in use before Letraset made it 
                        popular as a dummy text in the 1960s, although McClintock says he remembers coming
                        across the lorem ipsum passage in a book of old metal type samples.
                        So far he hasn't relocated where he once saw the passage, but the 
                        popularity of Cicero in the 15th century supports the theory that 
                        the filler text has been used for centuries.

                        <p className="about__wrapper-text">And anyways, as Cecil 
                        Adams reasoned, “[Do you really] think graphic arts supply houses were
                        hiring classics scholars in the 1960s?” Perhaps. But it seems reasonable
                        to imagine that there was a version in use far before the age of Letraset.

                        McClintock wrote to Before & After to explain his discovery; “What I find
                        remarkable is that this text has been the industry's standard dummy 
                        text ever since some printer in the 1500s took a galley of type and
                        scrambled it to make a type specimen book; it has survived not only 
                        four centuries of letter-by-letter resetting but even the leap into 
                        electronic typesetting, essentially unchanged except for an occasional 
                        'ing' or 'y' thrown in. It's ironic that when the then-understood Latin
                        was scrambled, it became as incomprehensible as Greek; the phrase 'it's
                        Greek to me' and 'greeking' have common semantic roots!” (The editors
                        published his letter in a correction headlined “Lorem Oopsum”).
